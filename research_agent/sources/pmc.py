"""PubMed Central full text, figures, and supplementary files.

`pubmed.py` gets you abstracts. This gets you papers.

**Why the S3 bucket and not `efetch db=pmc`.** The obvious move is a second E-utilities
call. It's the wrong one. The PMC Cloud Service open-data bucket is unauthenticated, has
no NCBI rate limit (88 concurrent LIST calls measured at 0.4s, against E-utilities' 3/sec),
and each per-article prefix already contains everything we need: a 924-byte metadata
sidecar with the licence and retraction flags, the JATS XML, a plain-text rendering PMC
did for us, and — the part nothing else provides — the figure images. `efetch db=pmc`
gives none of that and makes you download 11.5 MB to learn what a LIST call answers for
free. See `pmc_api_notes/` for the measurements.

The guards here, like the ones in `pubmed.py`, each correspond to a verified failure mode:

1. `efetch db=pmc` reports a closed article as HTTP 200 with a complete `<front>` — title,
   authors, abstract — and no `<body>`, with no error anywhere. We sidestep it entirely:
   in this bucket, an article with no objects is an article with no full text, full stop.
2. The object key carries a version suffix that CANNOT be guessed. Observed versions in a
   145-paper corpus: 1 (x73), 2 (x2), and 319 (x2). Hardcoding `.1` silently 404s.
3. A figure named in the JATS may not be retrievable at all. Across 409 figures in 77
   papers, 40 (10%) have no image object in the bucket — PMC never deposited it, most
   often for author manuscripts — and 21 of the remaining 369 (5%) are over the 500 KB
   MAX_BINARY_BYTES ceiling, above which `read_file` errors instead of returning an
   image. Both are detected before staging, and reported apart, because the remedies
   differ: one is gone for good, the other is a real image the sandbox can't carry.
4. Legacy paths (`oa.fcgi`, `oa_package/`, `oa_comm/`, `deprecated/`) are withdrawn on or
   after 2026-08-24. `deprecated/` still returns 200 today, which makes it a trap: code
   written against it passes testing now and breaks later. Only the flat
   `PMC{id}.{version}/` layout is used here.
5. `"".join(node.itertext())` — correct for an abstract — silently fuses every paragraph
   in a body, because itertext inserts nothing between elements. See `_block_text`.

One thing this module deliberately does NOT do is keep its output small. `pmc_locate`
returns ~2,000 tokens per paper (mostly figure captions) and `fetch_full_text` returns
~10,000, which is more than the interpreter's whole result budget for a single paper.
That is the intended shape: results live in the JS heap, get projected down to a summary
or handed to a subagent, and never land in the root model's context wholesale. The
prompt, not the tool, enforces it.

    Call this before `fetch_full_text`, always. It is the cheap triage step: it tells you
    what each paper contains and how many characters it would cost, so you can decide
    where to spend context. It returns section titles, figure labels and captions, table
    captions, and supplementary file names — but no body text.

    Roughly 53% of PubMed papers have retrievable PMC full text. A paper missing from
    `available` is not an error and not a failure of this tool; report it to the user as
    "no full text available" and fall back to the abstract.

    Args:
        pmcids: PMCIDs, e.g. ['PMC5904197']. Bare digits and lowercase are accepted.
            Get these from `pubmed_search` or `fetch_abstracts`, which both return a

            figures: [{fig_id, label, caption, file, bytes, readable_in_sandbox,
                unavailable_reason}] — captions are FULL TEXT here, so a caption-level

                by PMC or over the 500 KB read limit) `unavailable_reason` says which,
                and the caption is your fallback.
