"""Host-side cache reads and writes, kept off the event loop, with an idle lifetime.

The PubMed and PMC caches were written for `agent.py`, which runs one question and
exits. Blocking the loop there costs nothing, because nothing else is on it.

Under `langgraph dev` the same coroutines run inside an ASGI server, and that changes
the rules twice over. In development, blockbuster raises `BlockingError` on any
blocking syscall made from a coroutine, so a cached `read_text()` doesn't slow the run
down — it kills it. In production nothing raises, which is worse: a synchronous read
stalls every other run in the process, and the health check with them.

So every blocking call goes through `asyncio.to_thread`. The functions here are
deliberately forgiving — a cache is an optimisation, so an unreadable or corrupt entry
reports a miss and the caller refetches, rather than taking down a run over a bad file.

Note the distinction between `MISSING` and `None`: a resolved-to-nothing PMCID is
cached as literal `null`, and that is a real answer meaning "this article has no
objects". Collapsing the two would re-resolve every absent paper on every turn.

## Lifetime

Entries expire on an **idle** TTL — `paths.IDLE_TTL_SECONDS`, the same window that
reaps a thread's sandbox. A hit refreshes the entry's mtime, so a thread that keeps
working keeps its corpus warm for as long as it runs; a thread resumed tomorrow, or a
new thread on a cold machine, refetches. The cache is a within-run optimisation, not a
corpus. That is a deliberate narrowing from what this used to be — permanent until
manually deleted, which meant `data/` grew without bound and a "cached" result could be
arbitrarily old with nothing recording how old.

Expiry is global rather than per-surface. Every surface here has the same shape — a local
copy of something NCBI or S3 will hand back on request — so a per-surface TTL would be a
knob with no question behind it.

Two things follow that are worth knowing:

* **Freshness is checked before the read, not after.** A PMC figure runs to megabytes,
  and one `stat` is much cheaper than reading a file we are about to discard.
* **Only a *successful* read refreshes the entry.** A corrupt file reports a miss and
  keeps its old mtime, so the sweep collects it instead of the touch keeping it alive
  forever.

`sweep()` is what bounds the disk: expiry alone only stops stale entries being *used*,
not stored. It is cheap enough not to think about — a full `stat` walk of 1822 files
measured 10.6ms — so the entry points call `sweep_if_due()` at run start and it
self-gates to once per TTL window.

Set `RESEARCH_AGENT_CACHE_TTL` to override: a number of seconds, or `off` to disable
expiry entirely and get the old permanent-cache behaviour. `evals/run.py` sets `off`,
because a sweep whose timing depends on wall clock would add variance to exactly the
numbers evals exist to hold steady.
